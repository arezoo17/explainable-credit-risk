# Explainable Credit Risk

This repository contains the code and notebooks developed as part of my master's thesis:

**Title**: *Developing an Explainable AI Framework for Credit Risk Assessment: Improving Transparency in Banking*

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a credit risk assessment pipeline that balances predictive performance and interpretability. It applies **explainable machine learning** methods to support transparency in financial decision-making, especially for regulated environments.

Techniques like **SHAP** and **LIME** are used to make model predictions understandable to non-technical stakeholders such as regulators, risk analysts, and business users.

## Repository Structure

- `Credit_Risk_XAI_Thesis.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook including model training, evaluation, and explainability (SHAP, LIME).
- `Load_and_Split.ipynb`: Initial preprocessing and data splitting notebook.
- `data/README.md`: Instructions for downloading the German Credit dataset.

## Methods Used

- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Explainability: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Framework: CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project uses the [German Credit dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data).

ðŸ“Œ *Due to licensing, the dataset is not included in this repository. See `data/README.md` for instructions on how to obtain it.*
